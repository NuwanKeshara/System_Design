* Executing same operation multiple times produces the same result.

ex: ||-5|| = 5
    update emp
    set name = "Nuwan"
    where id = 123

Implement idempotency:
- add a unique ID(UID) for each connection and send the request with UID
- for database insert operations, replace it with upsert (if already exists update the record)
- for messaging, add a message id when sending it
- CRUD operations (idempotent: GET, PUT, DELETE    Non-Idempotent: POST)


Challenges:
- Operational Overhead for checking messageID or UID
- Increase latency
-
